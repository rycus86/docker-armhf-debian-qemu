This project enables building a *Docker* image to allow running *32-bits ARM*
*Debian* builds on non-arm hosts (like [Travis](https://travis-ci.org) build agents).

## Usage

Before building images from this image or running containers from those on `x86`
architecture execute the following command:
`docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static:register --reset`

As described in its [GitHub project](https://github.com/multiarch/qemu-user-static)
this will register the *static QEMU binary* that exists in this base image
for all supported processors.
